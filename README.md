# Captstone 1 Project: E-commerce website
## Page 1: Homepage
This page is what the consumer would be directed to immedietly view and would use to navigate the rest of the site. The color scheme and nav bar are established here and follow the user through the other pages. 
## Page 2: Log in 
This page consists of what a typical log in page would have. There are input fields available so that a user could log back into an account that they would have. Bootstrap is great so it made this page easy to make and also added nice quality of life adjustments that allow for users to see if the fields are improperly filled 
## Page 3: Register
This page has a similar look to the log in but its got a few more input fields for a password and a confirmation password field as well. The capstone also required a few radio buttons to ask how the consumer heard of the company so there are a few options there. 
## Page 4: Products
After a user would either log in or register for an account, they would want to direct themselves to the products page where they are met with 6 different items available for purchase on the site. These 6 items are vinyl records that are in cards using html and display the artist name, album name, a brief descripton of the album and a personal favorite track embeded from spotify. An add to cart button is also available that would lead the consumer straight to the checkout page
## Page 5: Checkout 
The final page available to the consumer is the checkout page. An already established checkout cart is set up so the required table can show the albums in the cart along with little detail about whats there and also pricing. Input tags are there so the user can put in their information so they can purchase the vinyls and at the end they would click the purchase button that changes appearance when hovered and clicked.
